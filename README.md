AI Drive disaster Relief and Response Application

ResQMap is a groundbreaking disaster response application designed to provide real-time assistance and support during emergencies. Leveraging advanced AI technology, ResQMap analyzes human mobility patterns during natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, and wildfires. By tracking the movement of individuals and assessing the impact of disasters on affected populations, ResQMap offers crucial insights to emergency responders, relief organizations, and policymakers.

We are developing a comprehensive application that utilizes data on human mobility during disasters to track individuals' movements and provide assistance in two key ways: physical intervention and financial aid. By analyzing human mobility patterns before, during, and after disasters, we aim to create visual representations, such as graphs and charts, to understand how people move and where they seek refuge during emergencies. This information will help emergency responders, policymakers, and relief organizations better plan evacuation routes, allocate resources, and provide assistance effectively.
We are utilizing Twitter data to investigate how people's movements change before, during, and after disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and wildfires. By comparing mobility patterns during disasters to regular times, we can learn how individuals behave and where they go for safety.
